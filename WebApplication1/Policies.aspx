            At Parlour, our client is our priority. 
        <br />
        In order to provide the ultimate client experience, we require 48 hours notice to reschedule booked appointments. 
       The Beauty Parlour reserves the right to charge a Rps.100 cancellation fee for no shows/late arrivals. 
       Understandably, life can throw some unexpected curve balls– with respect to the stylist’s schedules and other clients looking to book in,
      please contact us immediately if you are unable to arrive to your appointment and we’ll happily reschedule it for you.<br /><br />
   <b>The service charge will be applicable only after the fullfillment of a demanding service and in the presence of our staff. 
       Thank you for your co-operation!
   </b>
